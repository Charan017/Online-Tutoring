			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Tutoring was established as a means to provide access to tutoring for students all over the world. This way students would not be limited to particular subjects but would be provided a plethora to choose from. Not only can they choose to excel in those selected subjects, but they can also expand their knowledge in subjects which interest them or could further help them further their career path. Tutoring employees tutors from around the world who are experts in their domains. All of them are certified and have their bachelors and masters which have been verified by the Tutoring Team. We assure you that you are in the best hands. Our tutors will provide one on one, or group tutoring based on your preference. They will clarify doubts and present various scenarios for the students to completely and thoroughly understand the subject at hand. In view of the recent pandemic, it is now more important than ever for children to understand what they are being taught instead of being forced to blindly memorise for their exams. Here in Tutoring we place an emphasis on teaching methods and making sure that children do not feel rushed. Each tutor is trained to adapt to his/her students pace and modify their teaching style to convey the information more efficiently to the students understanding. Tutoring offers many subjects and many different tutors with a wide range of language possibilities. Look through the options and choose the plan which best suits you and your child ! Happy learning :)
